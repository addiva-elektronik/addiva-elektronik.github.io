To hide a post, add the following line to your top frontmatter:

    hidden: true

To reveal it again in listings, remove the line or change to

    hidden: false

Remember, any tags or categories you add to hidden posts, the tags
themselves will show up in listings.  The posts themselves will be
hidden though.
